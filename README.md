# *Rails, React, Browserify* â€” Example app

This is an example application, that can also serve as a working base, for my
article [Rails, React, Browserify](https://medium.com/@olance/rails-react-browserify-e315001d5974).

It shows how to integrate [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) together in a Ruby on Rails application.
